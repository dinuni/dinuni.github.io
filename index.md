I received Ph.D from the Department of Computer Science at Binghamton University. I worked at [Security and Verification Research (SVR) Lab](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/seclab.html) and [Operating Systems and Networks Lab (OSNET)](https://kartikgopalan.github.io/people/index.html), under [Prof. Ping Yang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~pyang/) and [Prof. Kartik Gopalan](https://kartikgopalan.github.io/). 

I obtained my B.Sc.(Hons) in University of Colombo School of Computing of Sri Lanka with First class honors, in 2014.
